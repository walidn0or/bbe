        The Virtual Education Project, inaugurated in February 2025 with 100 attendees including NGO directors, diaspora members, and U.K. government representatives, has reached a key milestone. In September 2025, the curriculum for the virtual English classes was successfully completed.

        The project now serves over 400 students across Afghanistan and diaspora communities in Pakistan and Iran. Following the curriculum completion, basic-level students will advance to intermediate classes, while advanced students will begin IELTS preparation. New students will be accepted through a Google Form application process.

        **Key Achievements:**
        - Over 400 students enrolled from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran.
        - On-ground schools have successfully graduated their students.
        - Virtual English curriculum completed in September 2025.
        - Clear progression path for students to intermediate and IELTS levels.
        - Over 300 applications received for new virtual Microsoft Office and coding courses.

        **Future Plans:**
        In addition to the new coding and Microsoft Office courses, we are excited to announce plans for launching dedicated AI and art clubs specifically for Afghan girls to foster creativity and technical skills.

        The success of this program demonstrates the power of technology in overcoming geographical and political barriers to education. We are committed to expanding this initiative to reach even more students in the coming months.
